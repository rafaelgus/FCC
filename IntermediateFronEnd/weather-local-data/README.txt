I just finished my [FreeCodeCamp Local Weather App](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/show-the-local-weather) today. As a developer, I find it important to document my works. Because whenever I learn or study someone else's work, I go straight to its documentation.

There are three user stories to complete the challenge:

-   I can see the weather in my current location.
-   I can see a different icon or background image (e.g. snowy mountain, hot desert) depending on the weather.
-   I can push a button to toggle between Fahrenheit and Celsius.

### A Brief Look: Design

 I conceptualize on how the weather app will be used. I also looked for inspiration on google, dribbble and other's works.

**Simplicity**  Then decided on a color palette.

Now for my resources, css grid and jQuery which I am most familiar with. I've also used [Erik Flowers' Weather Icons](http://erikflowers.github.io/weather-icons/).
